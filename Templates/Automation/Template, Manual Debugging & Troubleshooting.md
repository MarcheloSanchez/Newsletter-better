# Context

- **Test Case/Scenario Name:**
- **Test Environment (Staging/Pre-Prod/Prod):**
- **Date & Time of Execution:**
- **Expected Result:** (What the test case says should happen)
- **Actual Result:** (What you observed instead)

# Observed Behavior:

- **Symptom Description:** (e.g., UI element not displayed, incorrect calculation, slow response, etc.)
- **Screenshots/Video Evidence:** (Attach references if available)
- **Frequency & Pattern:** (Happens every attempt or intermittently?)

# Initial Checks (Checklist):

- [ ]  Are all test preconditions met? (Correct user role, test data loaded, required steps performed)
- [ ]  Is the correct environment/version under test?
- [ ]  Were the test instructions followed exactly?
- [ ]  Are there any known outages or maintenance windows?
- [ ]  Have you tried a different browser/device or reloaded the page?

# Known Issue Patterns:

- **Common Issue #1:** Input field not accepting data: Check if required fields were entered and in valid format.
- **Common Issue #2:** Navigation errors: Verify browser compatibility or confirm correct user permissions.
- **Common Issue #3:** Missing data: Confirm that the test data was correctly set up and accessible.

# Troubleshooting Steps (Decision Tree):

1. **Re-Validate Preconditions:** Check if the setup steps were completed as described in the test case.
2. **Repeat the Steps Carefully:** Rerun the test to ensure no human error occurred.
3. **Change Variables:** Try a different test user, data set, or device to isolate the issue.
4. **Check Documentation/Known Issues:** Review release notes or known bugs to see if this problem is documented.
5. **Reproduce in Another Environment:** If possible, test the same scenario elsewhere to confirm if the issue is environment-specific.

# Fallback & Alternative Approaches:

- **Alternate Paths:** If the direct path fails, try a slightly different approach within the application to see if the issue persists.
- **Simplify the Scenario:** Remove optional steps or additional data inputs to isolate the core problem.
- **Additional Logging or Notes:** Take detailed notes or screenshots at each step to provide better feedback to developers.

# Resolution & Lessons Learned:

- **Root Cause Identified:** (Was it a misunderstanding of instructions, environmental issue, or a bug?)
- **Fix or Next Action:** (Adjust test data, clarify instructions, report a bug to dev team)
- **Preventative Measures:** (Update test case instructions, add additional setup details, improve test environment stability)
- **Documentation Updates:** (Revise test steps, link known issues, add new troubleshooting tips to the knowledge base)

# Next Steps & Follow-Up:

- **Pending Actions:** (If a bug is found, log it and wait for a fix. If instructions need clarification, update them.)
- **Assigned to:** (Who will handle the next stepsâ€”developer, QA lead, etc.)
- **Re-Test Date:** (When to retest after changes or fixes are applied)
