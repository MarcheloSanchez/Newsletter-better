**Title:** Manual Testing Debugging & Troubleshooting Example

**Context:**

- **Test Case/Scenario Name:** Login to Application with Valid Credentials
- **Test Environment (Staging/Pre-Prod/Prod):** Staging
- **Date & Time of Execution:** 2024-12-06, 10:30 AM
- **Expected Result:** User with valid credentials (username: “testuser”; password: “Password123”) should successfully log in and be redirected to the dashboard.
- **Actual Result:** Login fails with an error message: “Invalid username or password.”

**Observed Behavior:**

- **Symptom Description:** Upon entering valid credentials and clicking “Login,” the page shows an error indicating invalid credentials.
- **Screenshots/Video Evidence:** Screenshot attached: (login_error.png)
- **Frequency & Pattern:** Reproduced on every attempt with the same valid credentials.

**Initial Checks (Checklist):**

- [x]  Are all test preconditions met? (Test user account exists in staging? Yes, confirmed in user database.)
- [x]  Is the correct environment/version under test? (Yes, staging environment v1.3)
- [x]  Were the test instructions followed exactly? (Yes, entered correct username and password as per test case.)
- [x]  Are there any known outages or maintenance windows? (None reported at this time.)
- [x]  Have you tried a different browser/device or reloaded the page? (Tried Chrome and Firefox, same issue.)

**Known Issue Patterns:**

- **Common Issue #1:** Input field issues—Check if username and password are case-sensitive or have trailing spaces.
- **Common Issue #2:** Permissions or environment misconfigurations—Sometimes staging credentials are not synced.
- **Common Issue #3:** Known bug from previous release—Login service timeout issues if server load is high.

**Troubleshooting Steps (Decision Tree):**

1. **Re-Validate Preconditions:** Confirmed test user “testuser” is active and password is correct in the database.
2. **Repeat the Steps Carefully:** Re-entered credentials, ensuring no typos. Still fails.
3. **Change Variables:** Tried a different known-good test user account. That also failed.
4. **Check Documentation/Known Issues:** Reviewed recent release notes. Found a mention that staging may require a new auth token setup post-deployment.
5. **Reproduce in Another Environment:** Tested on dev environment with the same credentials. Login succeeded there.

**Fallback & Alternative Approaches:**

- **Alternate Paths:** Tried resetting the password for the user. No effect.
- **Simplify the Scenario:** Just tested the login page alone (no additional steps), still fails.
- **Additional Logging or Notes:** Recorded each step and time stamp for the dev team.

**Resolution & Lessons Learned:**

- **Root Cause Identified:** The staging environment’s authentication service wasn’t updated with the latest credential database after deployment.
- **Fix or Next Action:** Report this issue to the dev team and request that the user accounts be re-synced or staging environment variables updated.
- **Preventative Measures:** Add a checklist step to confirm user data sync after deployments.
- **Documentation Updates:** In the test case instructions, note that if login fails with valid credentials, verify environment sync status.

**Next Steps & Follow-Up:**

- **Pending Actions:** Developer to re-sync the staging database with user credentials.
- **Assigned to:** DevOps team lead (John Doe).
- **Re-Test Date:** After the environment fix is confirmed (Expected next morning).
