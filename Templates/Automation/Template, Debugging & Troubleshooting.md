**Title:** ENTER

# Context

- **Automation Name/ID:**
- **Environment (Dev/Test/Prod):**
- **Date & Time of Issue:**
- **Last Known Working State:** (When was it last confirmed working and under what conditions?)

# Observed Behavior

- **Symptom Description:** (e.g., Unexpected error messages, script hang, incorrect output)
- **Error Codes/Logs:** (Copy/paste relevant logs or include screenshots)
- **Frequency & Pattern:** (Is it intermittent or reproducible every time?)

# Initial Checks (Checklist):

- [ ]  Are all services/APIs reachable and responding?
- [ ]  Is the network connection stable?
- [ ]  Have recent code/config changes been made?
- [ ]  Are dependencies (libraries, keys, tokens) still valid and unexpired?
- [ ]  Are there any known outages on related services?

# Known Error Patterns:

- **Common Issue #1:** (e.g., Timeout on API call: check if API endpoints changed)
- **Common Issue #2:** (e.g., Invalid credentials: revalidate tokens/keys)
- **Common Issue #3:** (e.g., File not found: verify file paths and permissions)

# Decision Tree / Steps to Narrow Down the Cause:

1. **Confirm Inputs:** Are input files/parameters valid? → If No, fix inputs. If Yes, proceed.
2. **Test Individual Components:** Run isolated steps of the automation to identify which segment fails.
3. **Compare Logs to Previous Runs:** Identify what changed since the last successful run.
4. **Check Dependencies & Versions:** Update or revert to a known working version if a recent update caused issues.
5. **Isolate External Calls:** Temporarily remove or mock external API calls to see if the error disappears.

# Fallback & Recovery Strategies:

- **Temporary Workaround:** (e.g., Manual run of certain steps, using a backup script)
- **Rollback Plan:** (e.g., Revert to a previous stable commit or configuration)
- **Redundant Systems:** (If available, switch to an alternate service or backup instance)

# Resolution & Lessons Learned:

- **Root Cause Identified:** (Describe the final root cause)
- **Fix Implemented:** (What was changed—code fix, config update, re-authentication)
- **Future Prevention Measures:** (Additional logging, automated tests, monitoring alerts)
- **Documentation Updates:** (Links to updated wiki pages, code comments, or runbooks)

# Next Steps & Follow-Up:

- **Pending Actions:** (Further testing, confirming with stakeholders, long-term solution design)
- **Assigned to:** (Person or team responsible)
- **Deadline for Follow-Up:** (When will the final confirmation or improvement be completed?)
